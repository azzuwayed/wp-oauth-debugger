## Requirements

- WordPress 6.5 or higher
- PHP 8.3 or higher
- Composer for dependency management

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files
2. Upload the plugin directory to `/wp-content/plugins/`
3. Run `composer install` in the plugin directory
4. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface

## Configuration

The plugin can be configured using constants in your `wp-config.php`:

```php
// Enable debugging
define('OAUTH_DEBUG', true);

// Set minimum log level (debug, info, warning, error)
define('OAUTH_DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL', 'info');

// Set log retention period in days
define('OAUTH_DEBUG_LOG_RETENTION', 7);
```

## Usage

### Logging

The plugin automatically logs OAuth-related activities when debugging is enabled. Logs are stored in `wp-content/oauth-debug-logs/` and include:

- Request/response data
- Token operations
- Error messages
- Security events
- User context

### Admin Interface

Access the debugger interface through:

- WordPress Admin â†’ OAuth Debugger
- View logs, tokens, and security status
- Manage active tokens
- Monitor OAuth server health

### API Endpoints

The plugin provides REST API endpoints for programmatic access:

- `GET /wp-json/oauth-debugger/v1/logs` - Retrieve recent logs
- `GET /wp-json/oauth-debugger/v1/tokens` - List active tokens
- `DELETE /wp-json/oauth-debugger/v1/tokens/{token_id}` - Delete a specific token

## Security

- Logs are stored in a protected directory
- Sensitive data (tokens, secrets) is automatically masked
- Access to debug information is restricted to users with appropriate capabilities
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- Security headers are verified and reported

## Running Tests

To set up the WordPress test environment and run all plugin tests:

```bash
./test.sh
```

- This script will automatically set up the WordPress test suite if needed.
- It will suppress deprecation, notice, and warning messages for a cleaner output.
- If you need to reset the test environment, delete `/tmp/wordpress-tests-lib` and re-run the script.

You can also run the setup manually:

```bash
composer run setup-tests
```

And then run PHPUnit directly:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
